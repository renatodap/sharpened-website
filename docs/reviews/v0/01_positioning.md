## Competitive Frame Highlights
- DIY tools (notion/sheets/habit apps) — fragmented, no AI reasoning.
- Single-vertical AI coaches — narrow scope; limited transfer learning.
- Wearables — data heavy, actionable-light.

## Open Questions
- [ ] Prioritize channels (landing, docs, social) for A/B test of angle A vs B.
- [ ] Which 2–3 proof metrics will we feature in the umbrella homepage v1?
