# 04 — Messaging Matrix

## Core Story (Umbrella)
Sharpened combines proven methods with AI to turn effort into measurable gains. You’ll know what matters, do it well, and see the progress.

## Elevator Pitch (3 variants)
- A) Precision Coach — "Know the moves that matter. Sharpened turns them into an adaptive plan you can measure."
- B) Systems Builder — "Design your improvement system with AI. Fewer guesses; more progress."
- C) Acceleration Layer — "Double the impact of the work you already do. Sharpen your edge."

## Taglines (restate)
- A) Your edge, sharpened by AI.  
- B) Measure. Improve. Achieve.  
- C) Turn technology into transformation.

## Value Props by Persona
- Hybrid Athlete: Adaptive training, recovery-informed planning, visible PRs.
- Exam Sprinter: Plan generation, spaced repetition, deadline tracking.
- Lifelong Learner: Cross-domain system, habit scaffolding, momentum.

## Channel Cut (Examples)
- __Site UI__: short, imperative; CTA-forward.
- __Docs__: clear, rationale-first; examples.
- __Social__: proof artifacts; before/after; shareable progress cards.
- __Email__: weekly recap; next best actions; small wins.

## Decision Blocks

### [Decision] Umbrella CTA Language
- Options: A) "Get early access"; B) "Join the waitlist"; C) "Start your plan" (later)
- Recommendation: B for v0; A/B test A vs B.
- STATUS: Proposed
- Owner: TBD
- Due: TBD

## Open Questions
- [ ] Which proof artifacts do we ship first (cards, charts, mastery bars)?
- [ ] Which channels run the first A/B (site hero vs email onboard)?
