# ADR 0001 â€” Brand Architecture

## Context
Sharpened operates as a masterbrand with product verticals (FeelSharper, StudySharper). We need a clear model for naming, endorsement, and IA cohesion.

## Decision
Adopt a Masterbrand-led model with product accents and shared design system. Use optional endorsement line ("by Sharpened") in external contexts.

## Alternatives Considered
- Endorsed Brands: more autonomy, more governance overhead.
- House of Brands: maximum separation, weak equity transfer.

## Consequences
- Faster cross-sell and shared infra reuse.
- Requires brand governance to prevent drift.

## Status
