# Sharpened Social Launch Strategy

## üéØ **Primary Audience: Engineering Twitter + IndieHacker Community**

### **Core Narrative**
"NCAA tennis player who codes ‚Üí building AI coaching tools that actually work"

### **Launch Sequence (4-Week Campaign)**

## **Week 1: Foundation Building**

### **Twitter Thread Series**
**Thread 1: "Why I'm building Sharpened" (Pin this)**
```
üßµ As an NCAA tennis player who spends half my time coding, I noticed something:

The same phone that tracks my workouts can't tell me if I'm actually improving.

So I'm building Sharpened - AI coaching that turns messy data into real progress.

Here's why that matters... 1/12
```

**Thread 2: "The Problem with Current Fitness Apps"**
```
ü§î Unpopular opinion: Your fitness app is lying to you.

It shows you burned 500 calories, logged 10k steps, hit your protein goal...

But are you actually getting STRONGER? FASTER? BETTER?

Most apps track activity. Sharpened tracks improvement. 

Here's the difference... 1/8
```

**Thread 3: "Building in Public - Technical Stack"**
```
üõ†Ô∏è Building Sharpened's AI coaching system in public.

Tech stack so far:
- Next.js 14 (App Router)
- TypeScript for type safety
- Supabase for realtime data
- Anthropic's Claude for AI analysis
- TensorFlow.js for client-side ML

The goal: Turn your daily data into actionable insights... 1/10
```

### **LinkedIn Content**
**Post 1: Professional Announcement**
```
After building blockchain light clients at Accumulate and competing in NCAA tennis, I'm tackling a new challenge:

Most productivity and fitness tools track what you DO.
Very few track whether you're actually IMPROVING.

That's why I'm building Sharpened - AI-powered coaching that turns daily data into measurable progress.

Currently working on:
‚Üí FeelSharper (AI fitness coaching)
‚Üí StudySharper (intelligent learning optimization)

If you're interested in beta testing or following the journey, I'd love to connect.

## **Week 2: Technical Deep Dives**

### **Twitter Content**
**Thread: "How I'm using AI for workout analysis"**
```
üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Here's how I'm building AI that actually understands your workouts:

Most fitness apps: "You did 10 reps"
Sharpened: "Your last 3 sessions show declining power output - try reducing weight 10% and focus on explosive movement"

The secret? Pattern recognition across time... 1/15
```

**Thread: "The Math Behind Spaced Repetition"**
```
üìö Why most study apps fail at spaced repetition:

They use fixed intervals (1 day, 3 days, 7 days...)

But your brain doesn't learn on a schedule.

Sharpened's StudySharper uses adaptive algorithms that adjust based on YOUR retention patterns.

Here's how... 1/12
```

**"Another fitness app?"**
‚Üí "Most fitness apps track activity. Sharpened tracks actual improvement. Here's the difference..."

**"AI is overhyped"**
‚Üí "Agreed! That's why Sharpened focuses on proven techniques (spaced repetition, progressive overload) enhanced by AI, not replaced by it."

**"How is this different from MyFitnessPal?"**
‚Üí "MyFitnessPal tells you what you ate. Sharpened tells you if your nutrition is actually improving your performance."
